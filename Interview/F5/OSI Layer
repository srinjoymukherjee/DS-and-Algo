Application Layer:
====================
Application layer provides services for Network Applications (Chrome, FireFox, Outlook etc)
It provides below services:
File Transfer--> FTP
Web Surfing--> HTTP/HTTPS
Emails--> SMTP
Virtual Terminals-->Telnet

Presentation Layer:
=====================
Major Functionalities:
Translation: Converting Text to Binary (ASCII---->EBCDIC)
Data Compression (Lossy & Lossless): Reduces the size of binary data for storage efficiency
Data Encryption and Decryption: Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is used for encryption and de-cryption of data in presentation layer. 
								Encryption increases data security.

Session Layer:
=====================
It uses APIs to establish communication between different applications, running on different Computers (servers/clients). Ex: NETBIOS APIs
Authentication: Once Username and Password is matched, a Session is established between Client and Server
Authorization: This is the process, by which a server checks whether a user has access to a particular resource
Session Management: Keeps track of packets which are downloaded and trace where they go. Ex. Sending Text packets to text files and media packets to media files

Transport Layer:
=====================
Data Unit in Transport Layer is called Segment
It controls the reliability of communication through:

Segmentation: Transport layer divides data received from Session Layer in Segments. Each Segment contains:
				1. Port Number of Client and Server
				2. Sequence Number, so that message sequence can be maintained in receiver

Flow Control: It controls the amount of Data Transfer. If it is larger than the Device Capacity, then it lowers it and vice versa

Error Control: 
				1. Automatic Repeat Request: If any data packet is missing in destination, transport layer re-transmits
				2. Checksum bit: It uses checksum bit to detect corrupted segments at the receiver

Services:
				1. Connection-Oriented Transmission---> Transport Control Protocol (TCP):	This is slower as it provides feedback, indicating the data is delivered or not
																							Lost Data can be re trasnmitted in TCP
																							Ex: WWW, Emails, FTP etc
				2. Connection Less Transmission---> User Datagram Protocol (UDP): 	This is faster as it does not provide any feedback
																					UDP is used in such cases, where it does not matter whether all data has been transferred or not
																					Ex: Online streaming, Songs, VoIP, DNS etc
																					
Network Layer:
=====================
It passes Data, from one server to another seating on different Networks

Data Unit in Network layer is called Packet

It is the layer, where routers resides

The function of Network Layer:
1. Logical Addressing:	IP Addressing done in Network Layer is called Logical Addressing
						Network layer assignes IP Addresses of sender and receiver in IP Packets
						IP Addresses are assigned to ensure that each data packet reach the correct destination
						
2. Routing:				Routing is a method to move data packets from source to destination
						It relies on the logical address format of IPV4 and IPV6
						This is done with IPV4 & IPV6 addresing and Data Masking
						
3. Path Determination:	It determines the best possible path for data delivery	

Data Link Layer:
======================
Data Unit in Data Link Layer is called Frame

MAC Address: 12 Digit Alphanumeric value, Unique for every NIC

Physical Addressing and Framming: 	This layer adds MAC addresses of sender and receiver in the Packets received from Network Layer and forms data Frames
									After Physical addressing, data is transferred from one NIC to another NIC via a local media (Copper Fiber, Optical Fiber, Radio Signal etc)

Media Access Control: Controls how data is placed and received from the media
						Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA): Keeps an eye on media when the shared media is free, this reduces collision

Error control (FCS): Tails of each frame contains bits which are used for error control to check for any error due to media limitations

Physical Layer:
======================
This layer converts Bits to Signal and Signals to Bits
